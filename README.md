# AG7TS3Data
Logging and analysis of AG7's TS3 users.

Uses NodeJS.

ToDo:

Add script to analyse the data that runs every hour. Will include:
Total users past 2 weeks
Total users
Most Active
Most Active past 2 weeks
Most used channel
Most used channel past 2 weeks
Active times (graph)
Time total for the past 2 weeks (per user)
Time total per channel for the past 2 weeks (per user)

Create a web UI to present the data collected. Include a live search (AJAX?) bar to filter results.

Add a tagging feature, which will allow for nicknames for TS3 identities to assist in searching (updated in the web UI?)
