# AG7TS3Data

ToDo:

Add script to analyse the data that runs every hour. Will include:
list All users past 2 weeks
list All users
Total user count
Total user count past 2 weeks
Most Active user top 10
Most Active user top 10 past 2 weeks
Most used channel top 10
Most used channel top 10 past 2 weeks
Active times (graph)
Time total for the past 2 weeks (all users)
Time total per channel for the past 2 weeks (all users)

Create a web UI to present the data collected. Include a live search (AJAX?) bar to filter results.

Add a tagging feature, which will allow for nicknames for TS3 identities to assist in searching (updated in the web UI?)

Search by user or channel
